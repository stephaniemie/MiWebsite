    <p>   Poverty is a major problem in Puerto Rico. According to Puerto Rico Report, in 2020, the poverty rate in Puerto Rico stood at 43%, almost half of the island’s population. The rate of children living in poverty that same year stood at a shocking 57%. Factors such as limited job opportunities and natural disasters, which have caused many to lose their homes and jobs, have greatly contributed to these statistics.
